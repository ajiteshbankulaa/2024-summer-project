Don't know how you found this, but this is just a simple project I am making for fun.

Thanks if you are interested in this, and I hope this is interesting or useful.

There are three folders one holds all the data used to test this,

the second holds all the actual iterations of the ML model scripts I used,

and the final folder holds all the scripts I used to clean this.

My script achieved an overall accuracy of 60%, which, in the case of stock market models, is pretty good.

The data was cleaned in Excel and also using the scripts in the cleaning, which mainly uses pandas.

The actual model is based on a random tree classifier, but it is heavily modified through stacking and hypertuning of the parameters.
