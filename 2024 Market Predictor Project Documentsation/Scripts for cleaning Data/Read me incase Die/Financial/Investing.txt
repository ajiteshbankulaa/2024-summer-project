This will vary based on how your financial state is. 

If there are people who are knowledgeable then listen to them. 

If not find a guide there are many people who can help you invest like financial advisors(be careful and make sure they are trustable and reputed)

Also don't truly relay on such advisors unless its a truly last resort

For example if there are no adults when reading this who are capable and knowledgeable in the least

I hope I leave when we are in a good financial state otherwise I'm truly sorry I wish I could have done more. But I cant so oh well.

Either way be smart and listen to others who are trustable and knowledgeable.

If that cant be found the best way is just put as much as possible in Bonds or CDs.


RANT!!!: Its odd im just thinking right now about finances and eventually some where my great great great grandchildren or someone related to me down the line even if i do well will end up broke or smthn so its odd ik I will never see that person but I somehow wish sometimes I could live in this fantasy world where my family would never have to worry about money. More than that not just the current one but generations down the line.
